# Lab 1: Hello World

### Description

The individual part of this lab is relatively short.

Create an app with 2 activities.  The first activity should show 5 buttons (you can put whatever text you want on them).  When a user clicks one of the buttons, the app should navigate to the second activity and display the text of whichever button was clicked.

Be sure to add course staff to your Github repo and then submit your work to Github.  Include relevant screenshots of your app running in your repo in an easy-to-find spot
