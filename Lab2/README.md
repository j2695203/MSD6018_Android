# Lab 2: Fragments + Drawing

### Description

Create an android app containing the following features/components:

The app must contain a single activity
There must be 2 fragments, the first needs to have a button which navigates the app to the second
The second must contain a custom View class
The second fragment must attach a TouchListener to the custom view which (indirectly) causes something to be drawn on the custom view
From the second fragment, the user must be able to return to the first fragment with the "back" button/action, and when they return to the drawing their prevoius drawing should be "saved" (in other words, if I do this sequence of actions: click the button -> draw somethign -> go back -> click the button, I should see whatever I had previously drawn)
I recommend spending some time planning and deciding which pieces you'll need before you start coding. Note: many aspects of this will be very similar to the code we discussed in lecture.
